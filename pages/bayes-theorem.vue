        &emsp;During the summer of 2021, I spent some of my time studying
        Machine Learning and Data Analysis. Within that period, I played with
        many ML models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression,
        Random Forrest Regression, Logistic Regression, and many more. I have
        made some predictions, visualizations, and classifications on numerous
        data sets on the web. Despite having experience in the discipline, I had
        little to no intuition about its mathematical foundations. I was only
        familiar with Linear Regression in Statistics but other than that I was
        clueless.

        &emsp;It was only when I learned about Bayes Theorem that I had my first
        glimpse into the inner workings of Data Science. I was amazed by the
        role of Probability Theory especially Conditional Probability in
        computing the Bayes Theorem formula below.

        &emsp;The spam filter and the disease problems also worked great in
        facilitating my understanding as I have also known that these are some
        applications of Machine Learning. This lesson has further cemented my
        belief that Artificial Intelligence is heavily interrelated with
        Statistics.

        &emsp;Learning Bayes Theorem in this chapter really opened my eyes to
        how mathematical concepts play a fundamental role in these technologies.
        It also made me appreciate the level of abstraction Iâ€™m working with
        when I code on a Jupyter Notebook. My perspective has completely changed
        and I am grateful that
